**ADDRESS-BOOK**

**Description:**
The Address Book program in C uses a structure to store and manage contact details, including name, phone number,and email. Each function is implemented to perform specific operations on the contact list. Here's a brief description of each function:

**Create Contact:** Prompts the user to enter contact details and adds the new contact to the list.

**Delete Contact:** Allows the user to remove a contact by providing a unique identifier.

**Search Contact:** Enables the user to search for contacts based on specific criteria.

**Edit Contact:** Lets the user update information for an existing contact.

**List All Contacts:** Displays all contacts currently stored in the address book.

This program provides a simple yet effective way to manage contact information and demonstrates the use of structures and basic file operations in C. Itâ€™s a great example of how to organize data and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a structured manner.
